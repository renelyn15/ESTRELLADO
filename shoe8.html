                <p class="card-text">The Air Max SC is here to tell you that its name stands for Super Cheap. We walked all day long with this Nike
                    pair thanks to its lightweight, flexible, and cushioned design. It features a big Max Air unit in the rearfoot that made us feel
                    like we were stepping on clouds, and its all-time fashionable style looked great with pretty much anything we wore. Especially sporty
                    outfits! Thanks to its running past, it also features an extra eyelet at the top and quality materials that supported our feet.
                    Nevertheless, we wished its outsole was a bit more durable.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The Nike Air Max SC should have a soft spot in your heart as well as in your wardrobe if:

                        You're looking for a comfortable and lightweight pair of sneakers to wear all day long.
                        You want a former runner to show off in the summer that looks good with pretty much anything.
                        You don't want to spend all your savings on your new shoes.
                        </p>
