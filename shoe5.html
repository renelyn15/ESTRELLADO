                <p class="card-text">The Fila sneakers seem to have varying sizes so it would be best to order a half size larger than usual.
                    Customers compliment the design and appreciate the fast shipping done by the seller. However, one customer received a defective
                    pair and ordered directly from the Fila website. The sneakers also have a standard width which is good for those with narrow heels.
                    The shoes look cool, has a cushy sole, but the toe part is narrow. Overall, the design is cool and customers liked it.</p>
